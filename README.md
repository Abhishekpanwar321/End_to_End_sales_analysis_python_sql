GitHub – Version control and collaboration

📄 SQL Analysis Highlights

The SQL script includes queries to:

Analyze total and monthly sales performance

Identify top-performing customers and products

Calculate key business metrics (revenue, averages, growth)

Perform customer-level and time-based analysis

Support analytical insights for downstream reporting

The SQL layer ensures clean, structured, and efficient data extraction for analysis.

📊 Python (Google Colab) Analysis Highlights

The Google Colab notebook focuses on:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend and pattern identification

Visualizing sales, revenue, and customer behavior

Supporting SQL findings with visual insights

The notebook complements SQL analysis by enabling deeper exploration and storytelling through visualizations.

Data Analysis Key Findings
Top-Performing Product Categories: The "bed table bath" category consistently leads in both total revenue and percentage contribution to overall revenue, followed by "health beauty" and "sports leisure".
Customer Concentration: Sao Paulo (SP) is the dominant customer base, hosting the largest number of customers. Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Minas Gerais (MG) also have significant customer populations but are considerably smaller than SP.
Sales Trends: Monthly revenue shows a clear upward trajectory, particularly evident from 2017 into 2018, albeit with some monthly fluctuations. Cumulative sales demonstrate steady growth over the period analyzed, indicating continuous business expansion.
Annual Revenue Growth: Total revenue saw substantial increases year-over-year from 2016 to 2017 and continued to grow into 2018.
Year-over-Year Growth Rate: While earlier periods exhibited strong year-over-year revenue growth, this growth rate appeared to stabilize or slightly decline towards 2018.

Insights or Next Steps
Strategic Focus on Key Markets and Products: Given the high concentration of customers in Sao Paulo and the strong performance of "bed table bath," "health beauty," and "sports leisure" categories, marketing and sales efforts should be optimized and potentially expanded within these established segments.
Investigate Growth Rate Changes: Analyze the reasons behind the stabilization or slight decrease in the year-over-year growth rate towards 2018. This could involve exploring market saturation, increased competition, or changes in customer purchasing behavior to inform future growth strategies.
